## How to play
The point of chess is to capture the opponents king. To do so, you must utilize your army.

- Bishops can move diagonally
- Queens are a rook and bishop combined, moving in all directions
- Knights move in an L shape and can jump over pieces
- Kings can move like a queen, but limited to one square per turn
- Pawns can move 1 square, if they have not moved they can move two in one turn
